# Reddiment

Reddiment is a Chrome extension currently under development, designed to analyze and estimate the sentiment and emotions evoked by submissions in specific subreddits. This tool aims to provide users with an 'educated guess' about the emotional content of posts, helping them navigate toward content that matches their emotional preferences and avoiding potentially distressing material.

## Key Features:

Sentiment Analysis: Leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to assess the sentiment and emotional undertones of subreddit posts.
Integration with Reddit: Utilizes the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) to fetch posts seamlessly from specified subreddits.
Emotion Detection: Employs the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and NRC Lexicon (NRCLex) packages to detect and analyze a wide range of emotions conveyed in the text.

## Planned Enhancements:

Backend Framework: Aims to incorporate the Flask framework for handling backend operations, enhancing the scalability and responsiveness of the extension.
Database Support: Currently integrating PostgreSQL databases to efficiently manage and query sentiment data.

## Motivation:

The inspiration for Reddiment stems from the varied emotional impact of Reddit posts, which can range from highly positive and informative to negative and stressful. By providing users with insights into the emotional content of posts, Reddiment aims to enhance the Reddit browsing experience, allowing users to select content that best suits their current emotional state.
