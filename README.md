## Introduction

Reddiment offers a new way to experience Reddit by providing sentiment and emotion analysis on subreddit submissions. By utilizing advanced NLP techniques, Reddiment helps users better understand the emotional undertones of posts.

## Key Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to assess the sentiment and emotional undertones of subreddit posts.
- **Integration with Reddit**: Utilizes the PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) to fetch posts seamlessly from specified subreddits.
- **Emotion Detection**: Employs the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and NRC Lexicon (NRCLex) packages to detect and analyze a wide range of emotions conveyed in the text.

## Planned Enhancements

- **Backend Framework**: Integrating Fast-API framework for handling backend operations, enhancing the scalability and responsiveness of the extension.
- **Database Support**: Utilizes PostgreSQL databases to efficiently manage and query sentiment data.

## Motivation

The inspiration for Reddiment stems from the varied emotional impact of Reddit posts, which can range from highly positive and informative to negative and stressful. By providing users with insights into the emotional content of posts, Reddiment aims to enhance the Reddit browsing experience, allowing users to select content that best suits their current emotional state.

## Technical Stack

- **Languages and Libraries**: NLTK, PRAW, NRCLex
