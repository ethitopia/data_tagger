# Reddiment

reddiment is a chrome extension, utilized to estimate the sentiment and emotions envoked by certain subreddit submissions. 
It's currently still under development, though it leverages the PRAW API and NLTK and NRClex python packages. Furthermore, it hopes to incorporate Postegresql db's as well as a frontend React framework. 

# Why? 

Although there are similar frameworks in existence, I hope to tailor this with a more intuitive use, able to be applied to each post within a specified subreddit. 
From personal experience, reddit posts, though largely informative and positive, can represent the opposite as well, and become a burdensome stress to redditors. 
I hope to develop this application so others can have a 'educated' guess as to which posts would better suit their emotional states.
